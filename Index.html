		<h2>About Ralph</h2>
		<p>Ralph is a simple-minded but good-natured 8-year-old boy in Lisa Simpson's second-grade class taught by Ms. Hoover. Although his beginnings were that of a tertiary child character along the same lines as Lisa's on-and-off friend Janey, he has since become one of the more prominent secondary characters on the show, even being the focus or at least a major character of some episodes.</p>
		<h2>Inside Ralph</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Ralph is the only son of Chief Wiggum and his wife Sarah.</li>
			<li>Chief Wiggum adores his son who returns this affection in turn, though Ralph can be quite a handful.</li>
			<li>Ralph also has an unrequited crush on Lisa Simpson</li>
		</ol>
